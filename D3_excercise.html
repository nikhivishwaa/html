            <pre align="center">moment I was in the air, Above the clouds, nowhere to be found. 
            One moment I was below the Earth, In its core I was bound. 
            One moment I was in a palace, And the other in a cottage so small. 
            One moment I was happy with a stick And the other, I hated my expensive ball. 
            
            Time changes as we go, 
            We canâ€™t follow it; it just goes, 
            Time is precious 
            So this is what we learnt folks!</pre>
